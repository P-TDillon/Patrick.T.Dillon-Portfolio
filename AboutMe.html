        <p>I am studying for a degree in Computer Science at Loughborough University. <br><br>
            I have studied a range of subjects including Python and C++  programming, Logic and Mathematics for Computer Science, Software Engineering and Computer Systems. For the remainder of my first year I will be studying Web Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Databases. <br><br>
            My A Levels and GCSEs included advanced mathematics and computer science, which equipped me with critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I have completed various online courses to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies using Springpod and CodeWithMosh.</p>

        <p>During the summer of 2024 I volunteered at the Nottingham Industrial Museum at Wollaton Park, Nottingham. I have gained significant experience in customer service and performed various roles which developed my leadership and communication skills. One of the roles  which I particularly enjoyed was  providing guided tours for visitors. I also worked on the cash desk, greeting visitors and providing information about the museum and its exhibits. <br><br>
            During the summer of 2023 I tutored a younger student in mathematics, helping them to prepare for the GCSE curriculum. I designed and delivered lesson plans and assigned homework using various online tools.</p>

        <p>For my A Level Computer Science project, I developed a fully functional chess game using Python along with the PyGame libraries. I implemented features that allow for different board dimensions, with  correspondingly different numbers of  pieces, making it suitable as a learning tool. <br><br>
            I earned a certification in Python Programming after completing online coursework through CodeWithMosh.com. I also learned the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) independently, and I pursued further certifications in C++ and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>I completed three separate Springpod work experience sessions. These were:</p>
        <ul>   
            <li>Technology Virtual Work Experience</li>
            <li>Fujitsu WorkX</li>
            <li>Computer Science Subject Spotlight</li>
